### How to use
 
You can create a grid using `stratum()` function. It gets object as
parameter with three options:

#### `padding:`

 - Set padding gaps between grid items. You can put *number* or *string* in such format: `padding: '15px 10px 20px 30px'`, which means 
 that you want to set padding-top with **15px**, padding-bottom with **20px** and etc.
 
#### `columns:`

 - Set an amount of columns in grid. Can be only a *number*.

#### `smart:`

 -  Accept *boolean* value `true` or `false`. Makes the grid more flexible and more compact.
 > **Notice**: Using this option script will set grid items in not right order. 
 
 If you need to add one or a few grid elements and it must be invisible then just specify `display: none;` or add class with this CSS rule to this block.
